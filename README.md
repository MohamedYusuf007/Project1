Computer World Website
Project Overview
This is a simple static website for Computer World, a platform aimed at helping people stay updated with the latest trends in computer science and web development. The website includes an interactive newsletter subscription form, a description of services offered, and several call-to-action buttons to engage visitors.

Features
Navigation Bar: A simple unordered list (<ul>) navigation with bold items for "About", "Contact", "Services", and "Home".
Branding: The website includes a logo and a header that displays the brand name "Computer World".
Newsletter Subscription: The website includes a form where users can subscribe to the newsletter by providing their name and email.
Service Information: A section detailing services provided by the company, including web development, AI, cybersecurity, and software development.
Call to Action: Buttons encourage users to learn more about the institute and subscribe to updates.
Footer: Contact information and a brief description of the company, including a James Bond-themed address!
Project Structure
The project is composed of two main files:

index.html: The HTML file containing the structure and content of the website.
newproject1.css: The CSS file (to be created separately) that styles the HTML elements, such as navigation, buttons, and other content sections.
HTML Structure

How to Use
Clone or download this repository.
Open the index.html file in a web browser to view the website.
The website links to an external CSS file named newproject1.css. Make sure to include that CSS file to apply the necessary styles.
The images should be placed in the img/ folder as per the file paths mentioned in the HTML.
Notes
Ensure the images (like logo cw.jpg and prt1.jpeg) are in the correct paths, as specified in the HTML.
The form submission will not work unless you implement the form action in a backend or link it to a service like MailChimp.
Some of the buttons and links (e.g., Learn More and Call to Action) redirect to external sites like YouTube.
Potential Improvements
Enhance the styling by customizing the CSS file.
Add a backend system to handle the form submission.
Make the website responsive by adding media queries for different screen sizes.
This should provide a clear and concise guide for anyone working with or reviewing your project.
